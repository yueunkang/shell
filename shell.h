 * HINT(s): This function is "essentially" an exercise in string parsing.
 *
 *         EXAMPLE#1, if the user enters

 *
 *                 at the shell prompt, line would contain "cd /mnt/cdrom".
 *                 Using the space character as the delimiter, the fields in
 *                 the command struct would be:
 *
 *                                 - argc = 2
 *                                 - argv = {"cd", "/mnt/cdrom", NULL}
 *
 *         EXAMPLE#2, if the user enters
 *
 *                                 ls -la
 *
 *                 at the shell prompt, line would contain "ls -la". Using the
 *                 space character as the delimiter, the fields in the command

 *                                 - argv = {"ls", "-la", NULL}
 *
 *         EXAMPLE#3, if the user enters nothing at the shell prompt (i.e.
 *         simply hits the return key), line would NULL, and the fields in
 *         the command struct would be:
 *
 *                                 - argc = 0
 *                                 - argv = {NULL}
 *
 *  Arguments:
 *      line: pointer to the string contains the cmd.
 *      p_cmd: pointer to the command_t structure
 *
 *  Return:
 *      N/A

 * PATH environment (env or short) variable. If the file exists, then the name
 * of the executable at argv[0] is replaced with the location (fully qualified

 *
 * For example,
 *
 * if command_t.argv[0] is "ls", and "ls" is in the "/usr/bin" folder,
 * then command_t.argv[0] would be changed to "/usr/bin/ls"
 *
 * HINT(s): Use getenv() system function to retrieve the folders defined in the
